== S3 Uploader Asp.Net MVC Example

MVC port of Nico Ritsche's (https://github.com/ncri) multiple file S3 uploader Rails example, which can be found at https://github.com/ncri/s3_uploader_example

And based on the great jQuery File Upload plugin: http://blueimp.github.com/jQuery-File-Upload/


* Upload multiple files straight to S3 without hitting the server first
* Gets around S3's lacking cross domain access header support by storing the upload form on s3, embedded in an iframe.
* Upload progress is displayed on the host server by utilizing postMessage browser communication.
* After a file is uploaded a post ajax request is made to create a resource for the uploaded file in the db.

== Getting Started

1. Build S3Uploader/S3Uploader.sln (make sure nuget package restore pulls all the dependencies down that you need)

2. Fill in the AWS S3 config variables within S3Uploader/S3PrepTask/App.config and S3Uploader/S3Uploader/Web.config:
    AWSAccessKey
    AWSSecretKey
    AWSBucket
    AWSUploaderPath

3. Set your server host in S3Uploader/S3Uploader/Scripts/s3_uploader/s3_uploader.js:
    var host = 'http://yourdomain.com';

4. Deploy uploader javascript and form to s3 (run in command prompt)
    Open command prompt and run S3Uploader/S3PrepTask/bin/{debug or release}/S3PrepTask.exe

5. Start web app and Upload All the Things!!! :)


== Notes

* The path for the uploaded files defaults to "uploads/:uuid" (see UploadsController). Currently the path must have the :uuid placeholder in it.
  It is replaced with a random string for each uploaded file, to obfuscate the file locations and to prevent overwriting existing files.

* To compile coffeescript into javascript within visual studio, install the recommended Mindscape Web Workbench extension:
